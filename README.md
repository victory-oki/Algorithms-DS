This repo contains code written during my journey to learn and understand data structures and algorithms

1 Fibonacci Number:
	Task: Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number Fn. 
	Input Format: The input consists of a single integer n. Constraints. 0 ≤ n ≤ 45. 
	Output Format: Output Fn.
	Sample:
		Input: 10 
		Output: 55
		F10 = 55.
		
2 Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number:
	Task: Given an integer n, find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number Fn (that is, Fn mod 10). 
	Input Format: The input consists of a single integer n. Constraints. 0 ≤ n ≤ 107. 
	Output Format: Output the last digit of Fn.
	Sample:
		Input: 331 
		Output: 9
		F331 = 668996615388005031531000081241745415306766517246774551964595292186469

3 Greatest Common Divisor:
	Task: Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor. 
	Input Format: The two integers a,b are given in the same line separated by space.
	Output Format: Output GCD(a,b).
	Sample:
		Input: 28851538 1183019 
		Output: 17657 
		28851538 = 17657·1634, 
		1183019 = 17657·67.
		
4 Least Common Multiple:
	Task; Given two integers a and b, find their least common multiple. 
	Input Format: The two integers a and b are given in the same line separated by space.
	Output Format: Output the least common multiple of a and b.
	Sample:
	Input: 6 8 
	Output: 24
	Among all the positive integers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (e.g., 48, 480, 24), 24 is the smallest one.
